# Detect_Banana_Freshness
The detection code is using KNN (K-Nearest Neigbour) method

This is one of my early projects from university. Here, I used Arduino UNO to classify the objects (banana üçå), TCS3200 sensor as the input, and LCD display to show the output. There's 2 types of class 1 for "Mentah" or raw and class 2 for "Matang" or ripe. The input is from the RGB colours of the objects. 

Feel free to try it yourself!
